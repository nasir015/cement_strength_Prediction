# Cement Strength Prediction

## Introduction

This project is to predict the cement strength based on the data from kaggle. The data is related to the compressive strength of different samples of cement based on the quantities of the ingredients used in them. The data was obtained from the following source:

### Data Set Information:

Attribute breakdown: 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances.

### Attribute Information:

- Cement (component 1) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
- Blast Furnace Slag (component 2) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
- Fly Ash (component 3) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
- Water (component 4) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
- Superplasticizer (component 5) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
- Coarse Aggregate (component 6) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
- Fine Aggregate (component 7) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
- Age -- quantitative -- Day (1~365) -- Input Variable
- Concrete compressive strength -- quantitative -- MPa(megapascals) -- Output Variable

## Data Exploration

### Data Cleaning

- Check the missing values
- Check the outliers
- Check the data distribution

### Data Visualization

- Check the correlation between the features
- Check the distribution of the features
- Check the distribution of the target

## Feature Engineering

- Check the correlation between the features and the target
- Check the correlation between the features
- Check the distribution of the features
- Check the distribution of the target

## Modeling

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- XGBoost Regression
- LightGBM Regression

## Model Evaluation

- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- Root Mean Squared Error
- R2 Score

## Conclusion

- The best model is LightGBM Regression with the lowest RMSE score 4.26 and the highest R2 score 0.91.
- The most important features are Age, Cement, Superplasticizer, and Water.

## Future Work

- Try more models
- Try more hyperparameters
- Try more feature engineering methods
